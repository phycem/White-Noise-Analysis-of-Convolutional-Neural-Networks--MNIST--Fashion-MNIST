# Convolutional-Neural-Networks 
Neural networks (NN) can be introduced to bias via the environment and data on which
the network was trained or the network constraints (like parameters). White noise
analysis (i.e. the subject of this paper) protocols investigates the inherent biases that
exist within a single neuron level and the network level.
The overall goal is to train two simple NNs on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets,
calculate average noise maps for each class in the datasets, determine what the model
classifies each noise map, and use the noise maps themselves as the classifier. A view
of the activation layers within each NN for each class should give you a peak into how
the NN sees the data as it passes through the network.
